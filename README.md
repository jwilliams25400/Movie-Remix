# Movie Informer
## Description
This application is made for Movie Lovers, it allows users to search for all different types of Movies. Depending on your searched input you will be given a list of Movie results. You will then have the choice to view more detailed information about a specific Movie you have chosen by selecting the Details button. We will also present the trailer for that movie to you since watching is always a welcome feature. Lastly we want you to keep your movies close to you so by creating an account you can save movies directly to your profile page where there will be online chatting feature allowing you to chat with our users.

## Installation
For installion of our application you will need to first install all our used modules, simply type npm install and it will intall all the necessary modules you need to run our application. Next type npm run develop so that our front end React application starts along with our backend database. This will then load up our application in your default browser under the url of localhost:3000. But do not fret if you are not interested in this method of using our application a deployed link will be right at the bottom of this README.
## Usage
We want this application to really allow our users to get any information they would normally want to know about any given movie fast and easily. With our UI youll be able to login/signup or logout with ease along with search for movies as the click of a enter key. This app is meant to be the center of peoples Movie needs and hopefully in the future the ability to buy tickets and go straight to the theater.
## Technologies
- For this application we used graphql to test our schema TypeDefs and resolvers, then created our queries and mutations based off of the information we had. 
- We used React as our front end to have a more seamless front end experience.
- We had multiple API fetches in order for our data to be presented on our page.
- Deployment used MongoDB and Heroku for our application to go on a live url.
